# Dota2Stat (DEPRECATED)
 
Description: Data visualization for a multiplayer game (Dota 2 by Valve). Website is called Dota2Stat which was hosted using Heroku.


Website does not work anymore since the API I used to populate the data have changed and the project was dropped afterward since I don't want to update it.
